# Project Description
In this project we used nrf52 to take temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, gyro, magnetic infromation and displayed into oled. Proper connection and runing the code will display outputs on the oled display

# Components Used
- 1 nerf52840
- 1 Oled display 128x32
- 5 wires
- 1 USEB cable
- breadboard

We used Visual studio code to run the file.
